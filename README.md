# Self-organized Simulation Model for Dictyostelium Discoideum Slugs Movement with Kilobots

The idea of simulation of slug movement in -*Dictyostelium*- discoideum with kilobots is to have a swarm of kilobots which moves in one direction in a decentralized way, in a leader-follower manner.


### Deployment

-Probabilistic six different options: finite-state machine of the individual agent:

         *SRLSRF  
         *SRLLRF
         *LRLSRF 
         *LRLLRF
