# Self-organized Simulation Model for Dictyostelium Discoideum Slugs Movement with Kilobots

The idea of simulation of slug movement in -*Dictyostelium*- discoideum with kilobots is to have a swarm of kilobots which moves in one direction in a decentralized way, in a leader-follower manner.


### Deployment

-Probabilistic four different options: finite-state machine of the individual agent:
    *Short-distance to the leader/ Short-distance to the follower (SDLSDF)   
    *Short-distance to the leader/ Medium-distance to the follower (SDLMDF)
    *Short-distance to the leader/ Long-distance to the follower (SDLLDF)   
    *Medium-distance to the leader/ Short-distance to the follower  (MDLSDF) 
    *Medium-distance to the leader/ Medium-distance to the follower  (MDLMDF) 
    *Medium-distance to the leader/ Long-distance to the follower (MDLLDF) 
    *Long-distance to the leader/ Short-distance to the follower (LDLSDF) 
    *Long-distance to the leader/ Medium-distance to the follower (LDLMDF) 
    *Long-distance to the leader/ Long-distance to the follower (LDLLDF)
