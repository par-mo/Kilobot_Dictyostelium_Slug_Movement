\begin{abstract}
Understanding the collective behaviors in nature and its potential links to engineering the collective artificial behaviors in swarm robotics have attracted the attention among researchers. They have various impacts on different domains such as cell-biology, cancer study, the swarm of drones and unmanned robots. Since the cancer cells share similar collective behaviors, the biomedicine researchers look into different examples from nature to design anti-cancer drugs to shrink tumors in human bodies. An exciting form of collective system is demonstrated by {\textit{Dictyostelium discoideum}}.

\section{Introduction}
The idea of simulation of slug movement in \textit{Dictyostelium discoideum} is to have a swarm of kilobots which moves in one direction in a decentralized way, in a leader-follower manner.

Each slug is about $2-â€“4 mm$, and composed of up to $100k$ starved cells. It is capable of movement by producing a cellulose sheath around it. The slug attractants to light, heat, and humidity in a forward-only direction. Cyclic AMP and a substance called differentiation-inducing factor, help to form different cell types. In the aggregation phase of \textit{d. discoideum} cells differentiated into prestalk(pst) which is $20\%$ of the population and prespore(psp) which is $80\%$ of the cells population. The pst cells move to the anterior and psp cells move to the posterior end of the slug.
